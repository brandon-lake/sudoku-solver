# sudoku-solver
A sudoku solver I started making over the summer in Java.
After learning JavaScript semester 3 however, this app would be much more practical (and less verbose to code) if written 
in html + css + javascript and uploaded to my schools server.

can solve Easy sudoku puzzles (by clicking next step button until solved)

Functionality:
- can check squares by row/column/box and add notes of possible solutions
- can recognize squares with only one note and fill in that square
- can adjust all relevant notes when filling in a square

** will code methods for more patterns later
** eventually will want code to check if solvable then offer 2 modes - user free play with hints, and a full solve button
